# Javascript RPG Game
 A translation from my Python RPG Game.

This project serves a multitude of purposes. 
1. It's fun.
2. To recognize the difficulty in translating code and ideas into different languages.
3. To learn Javascript/jQuery and brush up on HTML/CSS
4. To learn UI Development
5. To realize the difficulties of writing a project that takes months to complete.

This project will continue to be worked on for the coming months until it is in a state that I deem fit for public release, hopefully by the end of the year.

There are two facets to this project which include the website portion, and the game portion. To access the game portion, go into the  game folder to the index.html webpage. The website will upcoming be updated with information on how to play in the coming months.

Until then I hope you enjoy the project!
