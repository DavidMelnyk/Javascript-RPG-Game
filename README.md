# Javascript RPG Game
 A translation from my Python RPG Game.

This project serves a multitude of purposes. 
1. It's fun.
2. To recognize the difficulty in translating code and ideas into different languages.
3. To learn Javascript/jQuery and brush up on HTML/CSS
4. To learn UI Development
5. To realize the difficulties of writing a project that takes months to complete.

This project will continue to be worked on for the coming months until it is in a state that I deem fit for public release, hopefully by the end of the year.

There are two facets to this project which include the website portion, and the game portion. To access the game portion, go to the index.html webpage and click on 'Play!'. To learn how to play the game or about the various systems, browse the website at your leisure.

Until then I hope you enjoy the project!
